Use the terrain_sonar_mapping_api to scan underwater terrain and identify geological features. Validate result structure, report detected obstacles, and flag scan limitations.

**Response format:**
Provide a scan summary and terrain feature breakdown:
TERRAIN MAPPING REPORT FOR MARIANA TRENCH
=========================================

Zone scanned:              Mariana Trench (segment M-17)  
Resolution:                High  
Depth range:               Full (0–11,000m)

TERRAIN FEATURES IDENTIFIED
----------------------------

- Seafloor topology:       Steep trench walls with sediment layers  
- Geological formations:   Basaltic ridges and hydrothermal vents  
- Obstacles:               Detected sub-surface rock formations at 6800m

**Objective:**
1. Use sonar_data_integrator_api to merge sonar outputs.  
2. Compare zones using zone_comparison_analyzer_api, ranked by exploration value.  
3. Generate a report using submarine_exploration_reporter_api.

Validate all input datasets. Ensure report is suitable for planning or review.
