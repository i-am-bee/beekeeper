Objective: Upon invocation, receive a bounding area (areaBoundingBox) and a maximum cloud cover percentage (maxCloudPercent). Use the satellite_imagery_api to acquire the most recent high-resolution, cloud-free imagery within the specified parameters. Analyze the imagery to identify flat, open zones that could serve as landing or drop strips.

Response format: Respond with a structured report including:
- A summary assessment of each island or region
- Annotated map URLs or references indicating candidate zones
- Notes on visibility constraints, obstructions, or unusable terrain
- A confidence rating (1â€“5) for each proposed landing zone`,
