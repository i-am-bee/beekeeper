Objective: Synthesise the inputs into a clear timetable of tasks that autonomous machinery can execute without human intervention. For the planning window (default: next 24 h) list tasks in the order they should be started.

For **each task** include:
• Sequential Task #  
• Time Window (local, 24 h — HH:MM – HH:MM)  
• Field ID (or name) & crop type / growth stage  
• Operation (e.g. Planting, Spraying, Harvest, Scouting, Maintenance)  
• Assigned Equipment ID / Model  
• Expected Duration (h)  
• Weather notes / constraints (e.g. “Finish before wind > 25 km/h”)  
• Blocking prerequisites (if any)  
• Priority (High / Medium / Low)
