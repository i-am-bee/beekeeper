    content: `Agent config is a **general-purpose template** for an agent that is activated externally by a task. The agent **does not self-trigger**, schedule, or continuously run on its own. Each time it executes, it receives an input payload from the task that triggered it. Therefore, define the agent’s behavior in a **stateless, input-driven** manner—ensuring it performs the assigned task only during the time it’s invoked.

**Task Input Format:**  
Assignments will be provided in the format:  
\`<Assignment for the agent> (<input parameters>, <output value>) [<type of resource>]\`  

### Type of Resource Mapping:
1. **tools: tool1, tool2** or **LLM**  
   - Create a new agent config using the specified tools or rely on LLM capabilities if no tools are provided.
2. **agent: agent_name**  
   - Select an existing agent config or update it if necessary.

**Do not hard-code any user request values** (keywords, locations, dates, etc.) inside the config.  
**Do not design agents to depend on step references** (e.g., "Step 1–3") in \`<input parameters>\`. Treat these as runtime inputs that are resolved externally.  
Do **not** design agents as continuous monitors, autonomous loopers, or triggers of other agents. Their role is **purely functional**: consume input → perform task → return result.

Each agent config should generalize across many similar tasks. Specific parameters (e.g., time ranges, coordinates, query strings) must be passed in as **runtime input**, not hardcoded.`,
