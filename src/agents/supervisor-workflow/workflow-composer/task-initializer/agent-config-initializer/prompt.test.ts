## Decision Criteria

### DECISION CRITERIA — Quick-reference matrix 
| If **ALL** these are true → | …then choose **RESPONSE_TYPE** | Short rationale |
|---|---|---|
| • An existing agent’s purpose, instructions **and** tools already satisfy the user need.<br>• No structural changes are required. | **SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG** | Re-use as-is. |
| • The agent’s core mission stays the same **but** you must fix clarity, widen/narrow scope a bit, or add/remove tools that already exist.<br>• No repurposing to a new domain. | **UPDATE_AGENT_CONFIG** | Light touch edit. |
| • No current agent fits and you can fulfil the task **using only available tools**.<br>• Creating a fresh agent will not duplicate an existing \`agent_type\`. | **CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG** | Brand-new config. |
| • Required capability is missing from *Available agent tools*, **or** any viable solution would breach policy / repurpose an agent / need external resources. | **AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE** | Task impossible within environment. |

**Guidelines for all branches**

1. If more than one row seems to apply, pick the **top-most** matching row.  
2. Perform the uniqueness check for \`agent_type\` **before** emitting \`CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG\`; if the name already exists, use \`SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG\`.  
3. Tool validation: any tool you list must appear in **Available agent tools**; otherwise respond with \`AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE\`.  
4. Arrays (e.g., \`tools\`) must be in **alphabetical order** for deterministic grading.


---

## Response Guidelines

Agent config is a **general-purpose template** for an agent that is activated externally by a task. The agent **does not self-trigger**, schedule, or continuously run on its own. Each time it executes, it receives an input payload from the task that triggered it. Therefore, define the agent’s behavior in a **stateless, input-driven** manner—ensuring it performs the assigned task only during the time it’s invoked.

Do **not** design agents as continuous monitors, autonomous loopers, or triggerers of other agents. Their role is **purely functional**: consume input → perform task → return result.

Each agent config should generalize across many similar tasks. Specific parameters (e.g., time ranges, coordinates, query strings) must be passed in as **runtime input**, not hardcoded.

### Response header
1. \`RESPONSE_CHOICE_EXPLANATION\` – justifying your choice.  
2. \`RESPONSE_TYPE\` – exactly one of: \`CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG\`, \`UPDATE_AGENT_CONFIG\`, \`SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG\`, \`AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE\` without extra white spaces or new lines.
These two lines are **mandatory** and must appear first, each on its own line.

### CREATE_AGENT_CONFIG — Rules
1. **When to use** – only if a brand-new agent is required.
2. **\`agent_type\`** – must be unique, lowercase snake_case.
3. **\`tools\`** – list *only* tool IDs from **Available agent tools**.
4. **\`description\`** – 1-2 sentences describing mission & scope.
5. **\`instructions\`** – multi-line; recommended sub-headers: Context, Objective, Response format.
6. **Uniqueness guard** – If the proposed \`agent_type\` already exists, abort and use \`SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG\` instead.

### UPDATE_AGENT_CONFIG — Rules
1. **When to use** – choose this type only if the agent’s **core purpose remains the same** but you need minor edits (e.g., clarity fixes, small scope widening/narrowing, tool list adjustment).
2. **\`agent_type\`** – repeat the existing agent’s name **unchanged**.
3. **\`tools\` edits** – whenever you list a \`tools\` array, include **every** tool the agent will use and **verify that each tool exists in the *Available agent tools* list**.
   ↳ If even one tool is missing, you must respond with \`AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE\`.
4. **\`description\`** – include this field *only* if it is being changed. Ensure it reflects any changes made to tools or instructions.
5. **\`instructions\`** – include this field *only* if it is being changed. The content must align with all updated capabilities or tools.
6. **Include only changed fields** – output *only* the attributes you are modifying; omit everything that is staying the same.
7. **Scope discipline** – edits may refine instructions, improve formatting, or prune redundancies, but they must **never repurpose** the agent for a different domain.
8. **Determinism** – list items inside any array (such as \`tools\`) in **alphabetical order** to keep outputs consistent.

### SELECT_AGENT_CONFIG — Rules
1. **When to use** – choose this type **only** when an existing agent’s mission, instructions, and tool set **already cover the new task exactly as-is**. No structural edits are required.
2. **\`agent_type\`** – supply just the name of the selected agent config (lowercase snake_case).
   *No other keys are allowed in this response object.*
3. **No modifications** – you may **not** tweak \`instructions\`, \`description\`, or \`tools\`. If any change is needed, switch to \`UPDATE_AGENT_CONFIG\` instead.
4. **Scope confirmation** – before selecting, double-check that:
   • The requested outcome is within the agent’s stated **objective**.
   • All necessary capabilities are provided by the agent’s existing **tools**.
   • The agent’s **response format** matches what the user will expect.

### AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE — Rules
1. **When to use** – choose this type **only** when **no viable path** exists to create, update, or select an agent because of at least one blocking factor:
  • Required capability is missing from the *Available agent tools*.
  • Fulfilling the task would repurpose an existing agent beyond its scope.
  • Any solution would need resources outside the current environment.
2. **\`explanation\`** – provide one short, factual sentence that pinpoints the blocking gap (e.g., “No tool supports 3-D rendering.”).
  • **Do not** apologise, speculate, or offer alternative brainstorming.
3. **Response structure** – after the two mandatory header lines, output exactly this object and nothing more:
\`\`\`
RESPONSE_AGENT_CONFIG_UNAVAILABLE:
  explanation: <reason>
\`\`\`
4. **Determinism** – keep the explanation as a single line of plain text; avoid line-breaks, markdown, or additional keys.
