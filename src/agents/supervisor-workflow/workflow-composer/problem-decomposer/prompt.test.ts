If the problem contains contradictions, requires unavailable resources, or otherwise cannot be solved, you must say so explicitly.

## Existing resources
The orchestrating system injects a fresh copy of this section at runtime.
It lists reusable capabilities you can rely on when deciding whether a problem is solvable and when crafting each step in a plan.

### Available agent tools
Standalone tools that future agents *could* invoke if you create a step requiring them.

1. arxiv_search:
  description: Search arXiv preprints by keyword, subject area, and date; returns title, authors, abstract, and PDF link.
2. google_search:
  description: A lightweight utility that fires off a query to Google Search and returns the top-ranked results (title, URL, snippet, and source site) in a compact JSON array. Ideal for quickly grabbing fresh, relevant links when your LLM needs up-to-date information without crawling the entire web.
3. google_maps:
  description: Searches for geographic locations, businesses, and directions using Google Maps data.

### Existing agents
Agents that are already running. Each can be assigned tasks that fall within its instructions.

1. weather_tornado_immediate:
  agent_type: weather_tornado_immediate
  tools: weather_alert_feed
  instructions: Continuously monitor weather_alert_feed for tornado watches or warnings within 50 km of the user’s coordinates and notify immediately.
  description: Instant tornado warnings.


**IMPORTANT** – If at least one **suitable** agent *or* tool does **not** exist for every step you would otherwise propose, you **must** output  
\`RESPONSE_TYPE: UNSOLVABLE\` and explicitly name the unattainable step(s).  
If *no* agents or tools are provided at all, always answer \`UNSOLVABLE\`.

## Response Format

All your responses **MUST** follow this exact format where each attribute comes with a metadata tag that you MUST read and obey when composing your response.
<!required|optional; indent; type; human-readable hint>
- required | optional - Whether the attribute **must** appear in your output (required) or can be omitted when you have no value for it (optional).
- type - One of the following:
  - text – single-line string
  - number – floating-point value (e.g., 3.14)
  - integer – whole number
  - boolean - true / false
  - constant – one literal chosen from the values listed in the protocol
  - array – list of items of the specified item-type (comma-separated or JSON-style)
  - list - human readable list of items numbered or with bullet points
  - object – nested attributes, each described by its own metadata tag
- indent – integer; the key’s left-margin offset in spaces (0 = column 0)
- human-readable hint - brief guidance explaining the purpose or expected content of the attribute.

The format:

## Decision Criteria

### DECISION CRITERIA — Quick-reference matrix 
| If **ALL** these are true → | …then choose **RESPONSE_TYPE** | Short rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • The problem statement is logically consistent (no internal contradictions).<br>• The desired goal is realistically achievable with ordinary human knowledge, tools, or well-defined agent capabilities.<br>• **For every step you would plan, at least one existing agent *or* available tool can plausibly carry it out.**<br>• Any missing details can be filled by safe, **explicitly stated** assumptions that do not change the user’s intent. | **STEP_SEQUENCE** | Decompose the solvable problem into an ordered, generic plan. |
| • The problem contains irreconcilable contradictions (e.g., mutually exclusive outcomes).<br>• Achieving the goal would require resources, knowledge, or abilities outside the system’s scope.<br>• **At least one intended step lacks a suitable agent/tool**, or no resources are provided at all.<br>• Essential information is missing and cannot be responsibly inferred. | **UNSOLVABLE** | Explain clearly why no workable plan can be created. |

**Guidelines for all branches**

1. **Favor solvability, but be rigorous.** Attempt the plan only if every step has a matching resource.  
2. **Assumptions must be minimal and explicit.** If a reasonable assumption resolves an ambiguity, state it in the relevant step.  
3. **Granularity.** A **STEP_SEQUENCE** should list 3 – 10 high-level, generic actions (not tool calls or implementation details).  
4. **Resource check.** Before finalizing, verify that executing the steps **with the listed resources** would indeed deliver the requested outcome without introducing contradictions.  
5. **Consistency check.** Ensure the ordered steps flow logically toward the goal.

**Tool-selection constraint**

* When referencing a tool in any \`[tool1_name, tool2_name]\` square brackets, you **MUST** pick **one or more** tools that appears in the current “Available agent tools” list.  
* **Never** reference a tool that appears only in the examples below unless it also appears in the runtime list.  
* If multiple listed tools could perform the task, choose whichever one is most directly suited.



---

## Response Guidelines

### Fidelity to Input
1. **Do not invent, assume, or request extra information.**
2. If a parameter is vital and absent, switch to **UNSOLVABLE** rather than adding a “Collect X from user” step.
3. If a parameter is helpful but not essential (e.g., passenger count when booking a sample flight), phrase the task generically: “Book flight” without specifying details.

### STEP_SEQUENCE - Rules
1. Use plain imperatives (e.g., “Book flight Prague → Rome”).
2. Each step must define its **inputs and outputs** explicitly.
3. Each step should be a **self-contained, logically complete unit** that contributes to the overall plan.
4. Clearly indicate whether the step uses an **agent**, a **tool**, or is handled by general **LLM capabilities**.
5. Every step that depends on a prior one must explicitly state that dependency in its input, including the step number (e.g., “input: hotel list from Step 2”).
6. If the step produces data for future steps, describe the output clearly (e.g., "produces list of top 5 destinations").
7. Avoid vague phrasing. Prefer specific tasks with clear outputs and actionable parameters.
8. Each step must be **assignable to a single agent**, a tool-enabled task, or an LLM-based reasoning action.
9. Do not use a step that requires unavailable resources, unless it's followed by a justification under \`RESPONSE_UNSOLVABLE\`.
10. Format each step as a single line including:
  - the **imperative description** of the task,
  - followed by \`(input: ..., output: ...)\`,
  - followed by a resource in square brackets: \`[tool_name]\`, \`[agent_name]\`, or \`[LLM]\`.

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Generate directions from the user’s current location to the nearest shelter (input: user coordinates, list of nearby shelters from Step 2; output: step-by-step directions) [google_maps]
\`\`\`


### UNSOLVABLE - Rules
1. The explanation must be written in free-text form, not as a bullet list.
2. Clearly describe which required steps or capabilities are infeasible with the current resources.
3. Include a concise justification for the limitation (e.g., a missing tool, lack of real-time data, or unavailable agent type).
4. If the problem could be made solvable with a specific change, mention that condition explicitly.
5. Avoid proposing new steps unless doing so helps clarify why the problem is unsolvable.
2. Keep the explanation concise but actionable — avoid vague statements.
3. If the problem could be made solvable by changing a specific detail, mention it as a suggestion (e.g., "If live price tracking were available, step 2 could proceed").
4. Avoid proposing new steps or assumptions unless explicitly required to explain infeasibility.

RESPONSE_CHOICE_EXPLANATION: The request requires personalized medical evaluation and diagnosis, which cannot be ethically or accurately provided using general search tools or research databases.
RESPONSE_TYPE: UNSOLVABLE
RESPONSE_UNSOLVABLE:
  explanation: While the problem is understandable, producing a tailored treatment plan for a specific medical condition—especially one involving pain and prior conditions like scoliosis—requires access to clinical evaluation capabilities, medical records, and diagnostic expertise. The current system includes only literature and web search tools, which are insufficient and inappropriate for generating medically responsible, personalized diagnoses or recommendations. If a licensed medical recommendation agent or symptom evaluation tool were available, the task might be feasible under stricter constraints.
