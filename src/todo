☐ Problem decomposer
- It doesn't connect inputs/outputs between steps correctly. 
- Sometimes missing mark [source: assumed] - It should be rewrite to produce well defined inputs/outputs. Inputs should has a type user/generated all well connected to the specific attribute in request or output from previous step.

☐ Logic fixer
- Add step after the problem decomposer to fix the logic of the generated code. E.g. cyclic graph, missing conditional logic, unused outputs, missing deliverables etc..

☐ Input negotiator
- User request should be handle by a negotiator that will ask user for more details if needed (when request handler need clarification, or problemDecomposer creates step with grounded inputs).

☐ Disaster relive showcase
- It is too massive and uncompleted

☐ Boston trip
- Request handler and problem decomposer should failed due to missing date
