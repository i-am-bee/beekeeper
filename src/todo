☐ Problem decomposer
- It doesn't connect inputs/outputs between steps correctly. 
- It should be rewrite to produce well defined inputs/outputs. Inputs should has a type user/generated all well connected to the specific attribute in request or output from previous step.

☐ Logic fixer
- Add step after the problem decomposer to fix the logic of the generated code. E.g. cyclic graph, missing conditional logic, unused outputs, missing deliverables etc..

☐ Task Run Initializer
- Parallelism works just for the first step, it should be fixed to work for all steps
    - There should work something like Array.map for dependents steps
    - What if user input causing parallelism will not be put just into the first step?
